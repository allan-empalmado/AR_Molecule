AR_Molecule
===========

Augmented reality with 3D molecule structures. There's more details in [this blog](http://ianreah.com/2013/08/11/Augmented-Reality-with-JavaScript-Part-2.html) post.

## Instructions ##

- Download the [Android WikitudeSDK](http://developer.wikitude.com/download). Registration is required but you get a fully functional version of the SDK which is free to use for trial purposes.
- Copy `wikitudesdk.jar` from the Android WikitudeSDK to the `libs` folder.
- Download and print the [target marker](https://raw.github.com/ianreah/AR_Molecule/master/target.jpg).
- Build and run the application on your device.
- Point your device at the target marker
- Watch the spinning molecule structure appear

Or, [watch a short video](http://youtu.be/T06B_uyfRp0) to get some idea of what it looks like.
